The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations within CSS. However, if you make a mistake in the calculation, the browser might not display the error correctly or at all. For example, using an invalid operator or forgetting a closing parenthesis can lead to unexpected results or no visual changes.  Another potential issue is the use of units within `calc()`.  Mixing units incorrectly, like adding pixels and percentages without proper conversion, will often produce unpredictable output.
